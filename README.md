How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By applying the best testing techniques I am able to guarantee the quality of my code.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpret them as software requirements and try to extract from them the business logics and the hidden requirements that are required to make the overall experience work.


How do I approach designing software?

I start creating a list of all the requirements made by the user. From that I derive all the hidden requirements and business logics, and apply some logic testings to ensure that I have all that is necessary for the software to work. After that I create a flow chart to understand the software more visually.
